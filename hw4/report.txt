1. The SAT instance for graph 1 is not satisfiable with 3 colors.

2. With 4 colors, the SAT instance for graph 1 is satisfiable.

3. These results tell us that the minimum amount of colors required to solve the
problem for this graph is 4. Here is an example coloring assignment to solve it:

1 - Blue
2 - Red
3 - Blue
4 - Green
5 - Yellow
6 - Red
7 - Green

4. After testing several color amounts with the SAT solver it seems that the
minimum amount of colors to solve graph 2 is 8.
